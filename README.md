# Leap-Font Reconstruction
A reconstruction of the LeapFont from Leapster systems

## What is this?
This is a work-in-progress recreation of the Leap-Font by the late Brad Fuller. The samples were extracted from the Leapster BIOS at https://www.deviantart.com/smochdar/art/LeapFrog-Systems-Soundfont-Leap-font-PLEASE-READ-871610660. Some samples may be slightly truncated or have bits of extra data in the files, but will be useable for music nonetheless (although I might go back and fine-tune them, but this will take awhile as there are over 250 sounds).

## What can it be used for?
Making music, of course!

## When can I expect a useable .sf2 or .dls?
Soon<sup>TM</sup>. As previously mentioned, this will take awhile to process and finalize all of the samples and compile them into a soundfont. If anyone wants to help, please feel free to do so.

## Why are you doing this?
I wanted something beyond my usual skillset, and I wanted to do a project that involved music
